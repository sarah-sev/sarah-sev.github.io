title: "Automatic Projectile Launcher w/ ToF"
permalink: /projects/launcher/
excerpt: "Automatic aiming and triggering
projectile launcher using a time of flight (ToF) sensor to measure the distance to the target,
a stepper motor to adjust the launcher angle, and a servo motor to trigger the projectile launcher.
An Arduino program converts the distance measurement to the number of steps necessary for the
stepper motor to move the projectile launcher to the required launch angle. The Arduino program
triggers the launcher with the servo motor before resetting the trigger and moving the launcher back to its starting angle. Our final prototype successfully launched the ball into a 5 cm wide target at distances less than 70 cm."
